# Movie Cards Library CRUD! ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“š

Hey there!
In this project, i was able to:

<ul> 
  <li>Use componentDidMount to perform an action after the component is inserted into the DOM;</li>
  <li>Use shouldComponentUpdate to evaluate whether or not a component update should happen at that time;</li>
  <li>Use componentDidUpdate to perform an action after the component is updated;</li>
  <li>Use componentWillUnmount to perform an action before the component is disassembled;</li>
  <li>Use props.children to access the children of a React component and interact with them;</li>
  <li>Use the BrowserRouter component correctly;</li>
  <li>Create navigation links in the application with the Link component;</li>
  <li>Create routes, mapping the URL path with the corresponding component, via Route;</li>
  <li>Estruturar e organizar as rotas da sua aplicaÃ§Ã£o com o componente Switch;</li>
  <li>Use the Redirect component to switch between routes!</li>
</ul>

Let me know what you think about it!

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹
